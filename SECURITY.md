## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### ðŸš¨ Immediate Actions

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** discuss the vulnerability in public forums or discussions
3. **DO NOT** post about it on social media

### ðŸ“§ Reporting Process

1. **Email us directly** at [security@openaccess-mcp.dev](mailto:security@openaccess-mcp.dev)
2. **Include detailed information** about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### ðŸ”’ What Happens Next

1. **Acknowledgment**: You'll receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the report
3. **Assessment**: We'll assess the severity and impact
4. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
5. **Release**: We'll release a security update
6. **Disclosure**: We'll publicly disclose the vulnerability (typically after the fix is available)

## Security Response Timeline

- **Critical Issues** (RCE, authentication bypass): 24-48 hours
- **High Issues** (data exposure, privilege escalation): 1-2 weeks
- **Medium Issues** (information disclosure): 2-4 weeks
- **Low Issues** (minor security improvements): 1-2 months

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Policy Enforcement**: All operations must pass policy checks
- **Secret Isolation**: Credentials never leave the server
- **Audit Logging**: Tamper-evident logs with cryptographic signatures
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs

### Security Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: Default-deny with explicit allowlists
- **Change Management**: Ticket-based gating for risky operations
- **Session Limits**: Timeout and concurrent session restrictions
- **Output Redaction**: Automatic filtering of sensitive data

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:

- Work with reporters to understand and fix issues
- Give credit to security researchers in our acknowledgments
- Maintain transparency about security issues
- Provide timely updates on security fixes
